# hello-world

Hello world! My name is Andy and this is my first GitHub repository. I recently turned 30 this year and can't help be feel there is much I have not yet accomplished. Well, life is a challenge and I got another 30 years left in me to do great things. And hopefully another 30 years after that.

Let focus on this year first. I am creating a GitHub repository to learn how to use GitHub. I am pretty much a beginner when it comes to coding but I have made websites in programming class and on WordPress. I hope to improve my skills to polish my website and build apps.
